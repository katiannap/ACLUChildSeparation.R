# ACLUChildSeparation.R
In 2018, United States President Donald Trump enacted a family separation policy at the US-Mexico border. Under the policy, as immigrant families entered the United States, children were separated from the rest of their families by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and brought to detention facilities around the country.

Upon learning about this policy, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the administration. The government subsequently provided the ACLU with data related to the immigrant children separated from their families at the border.

As a concerned citizen of the world, I researched the family separations and got a better understanding of how many children were separated and where they were taken. Using the government data provided to the ACLU, I dug into the numbers and to gain an understanding of the situation. I did this by modifying and manipulating, i.e. inspecting, cleaning, and filtering, dataframes in R.

This was a great opportunity to understand our world, and bring to light the stories and lives of the people living in it.
